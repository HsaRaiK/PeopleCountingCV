# Here we keep track of which parts were updated and added on which date

1 . Video to frame feature was added

2 . Yolo network was trained and then used 
    2.1 Total number of humans tracked were kept
    2.2 The number of detected human was shown next to their face (this would be developed into a unique ID system)

Added the expriemental folder for trying different ideas

3. Version 0.4(b) :
    The program asks how many pictures the user wants to process and allows the process of all selected pictures one by one (good for demonstrations)

4. Version 0.5(b) :
    With the help of the vid2image.py, the attempt is to traverse the directory and process frames from a video input 
    (Work in progress ...)
